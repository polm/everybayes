School of Seven Bells (often stylized as SVIIB) is an American band from New York City, formed in 2007. It consists of Benjamin Curtis of Secret Machines with Alejandra Deheza, formerly of On!Air!Library!. The band is named after a mythical South American pickpocket training academy of the same name.[1]
Curtis met identical twin sisters Alejandra and Claudia Deheza while opening on an Interpol tour.[2] The three decided to end their commitments to their old bands, move in to a shared space, and create a home recording studio together.[1]
Their sound has been described as dreamy and ethereal, and the lyrics as abstract. However, singer Alejandra Deheza insists that the lyrics are not abstract or obscure.
The band has an unorthodox songwriting process that begins with lyrics, which are then supplemented by the music.[1] Curtis has said this is the most important part of the band with "everything else [being] accompaniment". A before-and-after example of this process is hosted by NPR's program Day to Day (starting at 3:50).[3]
In concert, Curtis, who stays mostly on lead guitar, can often be seen manipulating various electronic devices in between guitar segments.
Single "My Cabal" was released in May 2007 on the UK label Sonic Cathedral.
A twelve-inch/digital EP Face to Face on High Places was released in September 2007 on Table of the Elements, in addition to a single from Prefuse 73 called "Class of 73 Bells" that features the band.[2] The band then toured with Blonde Redhead and with Prefuse 73.[2]
School of Seven Bells' debut album, Alpinisms, was released one year later in 2008. They then went on tour with Bat for Lashes on her UK Two Suns tour.
School of Seven Bells' track "Chain" from their album Alpinisms was featured on an Adult Swim and Ghostly International compilation album, Ghostly Swim, promoted by Adult Swim and available for free download.[4]
Their second album, Disconnect from Desire was released in July 2010. It was hailed by Pitchfork Media.[5] During the accompanying tour, they covered the Siouxsie and the Banshees song "Kiss Them for Me".[6]
The band was awarded International Bet of the Year (Aposta Internacional) at the 2010 MTV Video Music Brasil.
On October 12, 2010, it was announced via the band's Facebook page that Claudia Deheza had left the band due to personal reasons.[7]
On November 14, 2011, it was announced in an interview with Stereogum that their third album, Ghostory, would be released in spring of 2012.[8]
